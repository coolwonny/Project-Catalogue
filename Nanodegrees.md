    - [Probability](https://github.com/iDataist/Probability): Examine Probability, Binomial Distribution, Conditional Probability and Bayes Rule. 
    
    - [Estimate Population Parameters](https://github.com/iDataist/Estimate-Population-Parameters): Examine Sampling Distribution, Central Limit Theorem, Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing
    
    - [T-Tests and A/B Tests](https://github.com/iDataist/T-Tests-and-AB-Tests): Test the effect of a treatment or compare the difference in means for two groups with small sample sizes
    
    - [Regression](https://github.com/iDataist/Linear-Regression): Build linear regression models to understand the relationship between independent and dependent variables, and make predictions
    
    - [Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/iDataist/Multiple-Linear-Regression): Use multiple linear regression results to interpret coefficients for several predictors
    
    - [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/iDataist/Logistic-Regression): Use logistic regression results to make a prediction about the relationship between categorical dependent variables and predictors
    
    - [Project](https://github.com/iDataist/Analyze-AB-Test-Result): Analyze results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website, and help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

- **Data Wrangling**

    - [Intro to Data Wrangling](https://github.com/iDataist/Armenian-Online-Job-Postings): Wrangle a CSV file downloaded from Kaggle using fundamental gathering, assessing, and cleaning code
    
    - [Gathering Data](https://github.com/iDataist/Gathering-Data): Gather data from multiple sources, import data of various file formats into pandas, and store gathered data in a PostgreSQL database
    
    - [Assessing Data](https://github.com/iDataist/Assessing-Data): Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas
    
    - [Cleaning Data](https://github.com/iDataist/Cleaning-Data): Clean data using pandas with the defining, coding, and testing process
    
    - [Project](): Gather data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. Document the wrangling efforts and showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.

- **Data Visualization with Python** 

    - [Univariate Exploration of Data](https://github.com/iDataist/Univariate-Exploration-of-Data): Use bar chart and histogram to depict data

## Data Engineering Nanodegree

- **Data Modeling**

    - [Data Modeling with Postgres](): Model user activity data to create a database and ETL pipline in Postgres for a music streaming app. Define FACT and Dimension tables and insert data into new tables. 
    
    - [Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra](): Model event data to create a non-relational database and ETL pipline for a music streaming app. Define queries and tables for a database built using Apache Cassandra. 

- **Cloud Data Warehouses** 

    - [Data Infrastructure on the Cloud](): Build an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team.
