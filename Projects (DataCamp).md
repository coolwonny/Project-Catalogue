- [A Network analysis of Game of Thrones](https://github.com/iDataist/A-Network-analysis-of-Game-of-Thrones):
  If you haven't heard of Game of Thrones, then you must be really good at hiding. Game of Thrones is the hugely popular television series by HBO based on the (also) hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. In this notebook, we will analyze the co-occurrence network of the characters in the Game of Thrones books. Here, two characters are considered to co-occur if their names appear in the vicinity of 15 words from one another in the books. The raw data constitutes a network and is given as a text file describing the edges between characters, with some attributes attached to each edge. The project conducted a network analysis of Game of Thrones.

- [Book Recommendations From Charles Darwin](https://github.com/iDataist/Book-Recommendations-From-Charles-Darwin):
  Charles Darwin is one of the few universal figures of science. His most renowned work is without a doubt his "On the Origin of Species" published in 1859 which introduced the concept of natural selection. But Darwin wrote many other books on a wide range of topics, including geology, plants or his personal life. This project investigated how closely related his books are to each other.

- [Comparing Cosmetics by Ingredients](https://github.com/iDataist/Comparing-Cosmetics-by-Ingredients):
  Whenever I want to try a new cosmetic item, it's so difficult to choose. It's actually more than difficult. It's sometimes scary because new items that I've never tried end up giving me skin trouble. We know the information we need is on the back of each product, but it's really hard to interpret those ingredient lists unless you're a chemist. You may be able to relate to this situation.

  So instead of buying and hoping for the best, why don't we use data science to help us predict which products may be good fits for us? In this notebook, we are going to create a content-based recommendation system where the 'content' will be the chemical components of cosmetics. Specifically, we will process ingredient lists for 1472 cosmetics on Sephora via word embedding, then visualize ingredient similarity using a machine learning method called t-SNE and an interactive visualization library called Bokeh.

- [Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing](https://github.com/iDataist/Dr.-Semmelweis-and-the-Discovery-of-Handwashing):
  Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital. In the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from childbed fever, a deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. Dr. Semmelweis found cause of childbed fever: the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. This project analyzed the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing.

- [Exploring 67 years of LEGO](https://github.com/iDataist/Exploring-67-years-of-LEGO):
  Everyone loves Lego (unless you ever stepped on one). Did you know by the way that "Lego" was derived from the Danish phrase leg godt, which means "play well"? Unless you speak Danish, probably not. This project analyzed a fascinating dataset on every single lego block that has ever been built!

- [Exploring the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Market](https://github.com/iDataist/Exploring-the-Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-Market):
  Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2008, hundreds of similar projects based on the blockchain technology have emerged. We call these cryptocurrencies (also coins or cryptos in the Internet slang). Some are extremely valuable nowadays, and others may have the potential to become extremely valuable in the future1. In fact, on the 6th of December of 2017, Bitcoin has a market capitalization above $200 billion. This project looked into the cryptocurrency market.

- [Give Life- Predict Blood Donations](https://github.com/iDataist/Give-Life--Predict-Blood-Donations):
  Blood transfusion saves lives - from replacing lost blood during major surgery or a serious injury to treating various illnesses and blood disorders. Ensuring that there's enough blood in supply whenever needed is a serious challenge for the health professionals. According to WebMD, "about 5 million Americans need a blood transfusion every year". The raw data is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive.

- [Predict Stock Trends from News Headlines](https://github.com/iDataist/Predict-Stock-Trends-from-News-Headlines):
  It used to take days for financial news to spread via radio, newspapers, and word of mouth. Now, in the age of the internet, it takes seconds. Did you know news articles are automatically being generated from figures and earnings call streams? Hedge funds and independent traders are using data science to process this wealth of information in the quest for profit. This project generated investing insight by applying sentiment analysis on financial news headlines from FINVIZ.com.

- [Risk and Returns-The Sharpe Ratio](https://github.com/iDataist/Risk-and-Returns--The-Sharpe-Ratio):
  An investment may make sense if we expect it to return more money than it costs. But returns are only part of the story because they are risky - there may be a range of possible outcomes. How does one compare different investments that may deliver similar results on average, but exhibit different levels of risks?

  Enter William Sharpe. He introduced the reward-to-variability ratioin 1966 that soon came to be called the Sharpe Ratio. It compares the expected returns for two investment opportunities and calculates the additional return per unit of risk an investor could obtain by choosing one over the other. In particular, it looks at the difference in returns for two investments and compares the average difference to the standard deviation (as a measure of risk) of this difference. A higher Sharpe ratio means that the reward will be higher for a given amount of risk. It is common to compare a specific opportunity against a benchmark that represents an entire category of investments.

  The Sharpe ratio has been one of the most popular risk/return measures in finance, not least because it's so simple to use. It also helped that Professor Sharpe won a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1990 for his work on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).

  This project calculates the Sharpe ratio for the stocks of the two tech giants Facebook and Amazon. The S&amp;P 500 that measures the performance of the 500 largest stocks in the US serves the benchmark.

- [The Android App Market on Google Play](https://github.com/iDataist/The-Android-App-Market-on-Google-Play):
  Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. This project looked for insights in the raw data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

- [Up And Down With The Kardashians](https://github.com/iDataist/Up-And-Down-With-The-Kardashians):
  While I'm not a fan nor a hater of the Kardashians and Jenners, the polarizing family intrigues me. Why? Their marketing prowess. Say what you will about them and what they stand for, they are great at the hype game. Everything they touch turns to content. The sisters in particular over the past decade have been especially productive in this regard. Let's get some facts straight. I consider the "sisters" to be the following daughters of Kris Jenner.

  Three from her first marriage to lawyer Robert Kardashian:

  - Kourtney Kardashian (daughter of Robert Kardashian, born in 1979)

  - Kim Kardashian (daughter of Robert Kardashian, born in 1980)

  - Khlo√© Kardashian (daughter of Robert Kardashian, born in 1984)

  And two from her second marriage to Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete, Caitlyn Jenner (formerly Bruce):

  - Kendall Jenner (daughter of Caitlyn Jenner, born in 1995)

  - Kylie Jenner (daughter of Caitlyn Jenner, born in 1997)
